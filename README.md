**Profit margin:** Profit margin is a financial metric that represents the percentage of revenue a company retains as profit after all expenses are deducted. It is often calculated as: Profit Margin = (Total Profit / Total Revenue). The formula used is “=Y4/Y3” and the result formatted as percentage. Y4 is the total profit, while Y3 is the total revenue. The profit margin is 12% and it is highlighted in the image below.
